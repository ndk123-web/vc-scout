# VC Scouting Platform - Product Definition

## LEVEL 0: Product DNA

### WHO USES IT?
**VCs, Angel Investors, Scout Networks**

Power users who need to discover startups early, validate thesis fit, and track deal flow without information overload.

### WHAT PAIN DOES IT SOLVE?
1. **Manual Scouting Fatigue** - Hours spent manually researching each startup across 10+ websites
2. **Information Noise** - Mixed signals from Twitter, Crunchbase, inconsistent data sources
3. **Thesis Misalignment** - Seeing companies that don't fit investment criteria
4. **Opportunity Tracking** - No centralized place to track companies + reasons why they matter

### YOUR EDGE?
- **AI-Powered Enrichment** - One URL → automatic web scrape + Gemini analysis → structured signals
- **Explainable Signals** - Not a black box score. See exactly *why* a company ranks high
- **Thesis-First Design** - Filter by investor thesis, not generic metrics
- **Live Data** - Real-time enrichment keeps company info fresh, not stale
